# Synthetic Image Generation: Backgrounds and Fonts

This project generates synthetic images with text over varied backgrounds using different fonts. This README provides instructions for organizing background images and font files in the `bg` and `fonts` folders.

## Folders Overview

- `bg`: This folder contains the background images used for generating synthetic images.
- `fonts`: This folder contains the font files (.ttf) used for drawing text on the background images.

## Background Images (`bg` Folder)

### Description

The `bg` folder should contain images that will serve as backgrounds for the synthetic text images. These images can be of various types, such as nature scenes, abstract patterns, textures, etc.

### Requirements

- Supported formats: `.jpg`
- Recommended resolution: Any, but preferably not too small to maintain image quality when resized.
- Ensure diversity in the images to help the model generalize better.

### Example Usage

1. Download or collect a variety of background images.
2. Save these images in the `bg` folder.
